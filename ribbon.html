                How do you play Ribbon? The idea is to keep the ribbon
                'alive' by not crashing into anything as you fly through
                the cave. The ribbon is magically self-propelling; you
                just need to keep it up in the air.  You can do this by
                pressing and holding any key on your keyboard after you
                click-to-play. This will provide an upward force to the
                ribbon and therefore make it fly upwards. If you want
                the ribbon to come back down again just release the key
                and let gravity do its job. It's that simple! Your score
                will increase as you progress. See if you can get one of
                the all-time top scores. Good luck!
                </p>

                For those of you interested: Ribbon is written
                entirely using pure JavaScript and HTML5 technologies.
                There is no flash on this page!  JQuery is used to help
                out with the small amount of AJAX used in the
                scoreboard. You can find the source for this small
                project here. Ribbon was written for fun and as such
                does not jump through hoops to be cross-browser
                compatible. The latest version of
                <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/chrome">Chrome</a> or
                <a href="http://www.mozilla.com">Firefox</a> should work
                just fine though.
