# Ribbon

Ribbon is an open source HTML5/JavaScript game. The idea is to fly the
ribbon through the cave avoiding all of the obstacles and walls.

You can [play the game here](http://www.gregsexton.org/ribbon/ribbon.html).

Here is a screenshot of the game in action.

## How do you play Ribbon?

The idea is to keep the ribbon ‘alive’ by not crashing into anything as
you fly through the cave. The ribbon is magically self-propelling; you
just need to keep it up in the air. You can do this by pressing and
holding any key on your keyboard after you click-to-play. This will
provide an upward force to the ribbon and therefore make it fly upwards.
If you want the ribbon to come back down again just release the key and
let gravity do its job. It’s that simple! Your score will increase as
you progress. See if you can get one of the all-time top scores. Good
luck!

## Technical Details 

For those of you interested: Ribbon is written entirely using pure
JavaScript, (valid) HTML5 and (valid) CSS3 technologies. There is no
flash on the page! JQuery is used to help out with the small amount of
AJAX used in the scoreboard. Ribbon was written for fun and as such does
not jump through hoops to be cross-browser compatible. The latest
version of Chrome or Firefox should work just fine though.
